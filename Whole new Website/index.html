        <div class="p"><p id="p">My hobby is chess. Chess gets its appeal to the human psyche because of its logic, reasoning, aesthetic, adventurous and empowering elements. It is considered as a creative quest with endless opportunities, as an escape from the ills of life. I also like it bacause of all the strategies that can occur in a single game. This makes chess seem amazing to me. I also love how there is not one exact way to play it.</p></div>
